# Email-Spammer
A simple JavaScript snippet to spam emails with a message repeating a given number of times.
This snippet prompts the user to input the number of emails they want to send and the recipient email address, then sends the specified number of emails every 2 minutes. It also includes rate limiting logic to avoid getting flagged for spamming. The program stops after sending emails for 1 hour.


## Tips
- Send messages in chunks smaller than 50 messages at a go to avoid server from timing out.
- By default, Gmail accounts have a sending limit of 500 emails per day. Gmail Workspace (formerly G Suite) accounts have a sending limit of 2000 emails per day.
- If Gmail detects the email bomber, sending from that account may be temporarily paused; use at your own risk.
